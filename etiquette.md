# Workgroup Etiquette

1. Video meetings take place under the [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule):
    
    Participants are free to use the information received, but neither the identity nor the affiliation of the speaker(s), nor that of any other participant, may be revealed.

There will be one exception to this rule: Meeting summaries published to this repository should include a list of the developers in attendence and their respective ecosystem association.  Summaries will have their contents otherwise anonymized.

2. Non-constructive criticism, name calling, speaking over others, or otherwise being disruptive to professional discussion is strictly prohibited.

3. Lurking in video meetings is generally frowned upon. These meetings are intended for productive discussion by ecosystem developers.  Inquisitive parties should look for meeting summaries.  If there are too many non-participant attendees, the chairperson may remove people.

4. Be punctual. Meetings start with introductions, if you miss them you will do yourself a disservice and disrupt the meeting if you need to be introduced.

5. Meetings should be scheduled for maximal developer participation.

6. Mind your microphone, and be focused on the discussion.  If you are not devoting your attention to the meeting, you should instead read the meeting summary.

7. Chairpeople should be dispassionate toward the discussion topic, and not partipate in the discussion.
